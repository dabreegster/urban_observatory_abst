## UX feedback

- Showing plots and the interpolation options super useful!
- I figured out the URL by using Firefox's network inspector. Maybe tick a box
  to show URLs for the current options selected?
- Where do I find the coordinates / metadata given a sensor?
- How do I get all sensors in an area?
